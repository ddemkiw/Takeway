Takeaway
=======================

This a very small takeaway-ordering application interacts with the Twilio API, allowing users to receive an SMS confirmation of their order with an ETA for delivery.


## Technologies Used

- RUBY
- Twilio API
- RSPEC

##Context

Week 2 Challenge (Test) at Makers Academy


## Still to complete/refactor

- remove dependancy from Restaurant class
- remove outputs from command line

## Reflections

This was a good reminder of OOO Design  and Backend development. I briefly got carried away with outputting to command line to bolster my confidence in app. In the future, I will ensure that my tests are robust enough to ensure my confidence in the app instead. 

Working on a new challenge today and returning to this app to help with good OOD
